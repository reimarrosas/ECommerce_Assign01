    <h3>Project Proposal</h3>

    <p>We will build a trading web application where users can list, sell and buy Pokemon Cards.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-3">Our project supports the following features:</h3>
    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can login and logout into and from my account.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can like post from another user</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can search for cards by their names</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can add/delete/modify cards in my profile</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can set the rarity of the cards that I posted from common to legendary</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a user, I can sort post based on their price, likes, rarity, and post date.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I an browse for cards that are available for sale.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I can save posts from another user in case I want to buy them later.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I can have a balance in my account for buying.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I can add/remove cards to a cart for checkout.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I can add stars to a seller's profile to rate their service.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a buyer, I can offer on a card sold by another user.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a seller, I can list cards from my profile for sale.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">As a seller, I can see the list of offers from other users and select the one I liked the most.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mt-3 mb-5">We will model our solution using Facebook's UI and EBay's functionality. We estimate that we will spend a total of 160 hours building this product, i.e. 80 hours per team member.</p>
